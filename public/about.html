<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m an aspiring web developer with 10 years of professional experience as a casino croupier. <br> Working in fast-paced, high-pressure environments helped me develop strong attention to detail, <br> problem-solving skills, and discipline—qualities I now apply to coding and web development. <br>

I’m currently focused on building solid web development skills through hands-on projects <br> and continuous learning, with the goal of creating clean, reliable, and user-friendly digital experiences.</p>
